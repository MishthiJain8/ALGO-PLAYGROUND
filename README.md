# ALGO PLAYGROUND

Algo Playground is a Java-based desktop application built to make learning algorithms feel more interactive and less intimidating. Instead of working through the command line, users can simply open the app, choose an algorithm, enter their input, and instantly see how it works. It’s designed for students, beginners, and anyone who wants to strengthen their understanding of Data Structures and Algorithms in a more visual and approachable way.

The application currently supports a range of essential algorithms, including popular sorting methods like Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, and Insertion Sort, as well as Binary Search and Fibonacci (both iterative and recursive approaches). It also extends into graph traversal with Breadth-First Search (BFS). Each algorithm processes the user’s input and displays the results clearly within the interface, helping users grasp logic and execution flow step by step.

By offering an easy-to-use Swing-based GUI and structured output, Algo Playground creates a smooth learning experience that can support practice, revision, or demonstration purposes. It’s a helpful companion for anyone looking to explore algorithms with clarity and simplicity.
